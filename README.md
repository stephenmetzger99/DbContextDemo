# DbContextDemo

This project's goal is to illustrate how the dbcontext acts as a unit of work. 

This project does not aim to be a perfect reference architecture. 

Certain tradeoffs were made for purposes of sinplifying the demo. 

For one, the whole backend is one project file. 

It is broken into
* Api Layer
* Service layer
  There is only one service, which plays a central role to this demo. 
  Most of the endpoints bypass the service layer, except the POST /orders endpoint
* Peristance
  Most of the work was spent here
  There are multiple Repos that use dbcontext differently.
   

A standard generic repository is used. Generic repos arent ideal but they suffice for a quick demo.
